# Park-a-lot Admin Website

An accompanying website for our app "Park-a-lot". This website is for developers of the app and also for our partners, the respective staff of each carpark. It allows the staff to edit things related to the carpark they are associated with and give developers complete control over the information that the mobile app has to access. The developers are able to create, delete and edit various data and work upon it when our partners and users send problem requests.
 
## Design Process
 
 This website is mainly for developers to help our users and partners when they face an issue on their app or wants to make edits that the app doesn't currently have as a feature. It is also for staff to make edits to their own profile, make requests to the developers and edit, delete and add things related to the carpark they are in charge of. 
 Our partners are referred to staff and our developers are referred to as admin.

 - As a partner or developer, I want to customised my own profile and change my personal information so that I can personalised my information and pictures.
 - As a partner or developer, I want to be able to communicate with other users and developers if they have an issue and want to reach out to me.

 - As a partner, I want to see the details of my company's carpark so that I can stay updated and assist in any issues.
 - As a partner, I want to be able to change the picture and information of my company's carpark so that the information can stay updated.
 - As a partner, I want to be able to add and edit the lots in my company's carpark so that any users will see the updated lots to park in.
 - As a partner, I want to be able to add staff to the carpark so that my co-worker that just joined can have access to the admin website as well.

 - As a developer, I would like to delete, edit and update the carparks, vehicles and users so that I can deal with any issue from the user or staff efficiently.
 - As a developer, I would like to be able to add another developer account so that new developers can have admin access to this admin website.

These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
